# program to print union,intersection,difference,symmetric difference
A={11,9,7,5,3,2,1,0}
B={1,2,3,4,6,8,10}
# union of two sets
print(set(a.union(b)))
# intersection of two sets
print(set(a.intersection(b)))
# difference of two sets
print(set(a.difference(b)))
# symmetric difference of two sets
print(set(a.symmetric_difference(b)))

output:
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}
{1, 2, 3}
{0, 5, 7, 9, 11}
